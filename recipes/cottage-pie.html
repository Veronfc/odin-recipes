        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For cottage pie filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50ml</strong> olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 large</strong> onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li><strong>650g</strong> beef mince</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> tomato purée</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> plain flour</li>
            <li><strong>150ml red</strong> wine</li>
            <li><strong>4 sprigs</strong> fresh thyme, <em>leaves only</em></li>
            <li><strong>400ml</strong> beef stock</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For mash</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>900g</strong> potatoes, <em>peeled and chopped</em></li>
            <li><strong>115g</strong> butter</li>
            <li><strong>125ml</strong> milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To serve</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>150g</strong> frozen peas</li>
            <li><strong>50g</strong> butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat half the oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onion and cook until softened. Tip it onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining oil. When it's hot, fry the mince, in batches if needed, <strong>for 4-5 minutes</strong>, or until browned all over. Stir in the cooked onion and tomato purée and <strong>cook for 1 minute</strong>. Stir in the flour and cook for a further minute. Pour in the red wine, scraping up any caramelised bits with a wooden spoon, and add the thyme.</li>
            <li>Add the stock and <strong>simmer for 45 minutes</strong>, or until the mince is tender and the mixture has thickened. Season to taste, and add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. <em>Keep warm over a very low heat. Preheat the grill to high.</em></li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the mash, put the potatoes in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and <strong>simmer for 12-15 minutes</strong>, or until they are tender. Drain and return the potatoes to the pan, then place over the heat for about 1 minute to drive off any excess moisture. Mash well, then add the butter and milk, beating to form a smooth mash. Season to taste.</li>
            <li>Put the cottage pie filling in a baking dish and spoon the mash over the top. <strong>Grill for 8-10 minutes</strong> , or until golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil the peas in boiling water in a small saucepan for <strong>3-4 minutes</strong> , then drain and add the butter. Serve the cottage pie with the peas.</li>
